<h2>Color Tag</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A two player game where one player will constantly be chasing the other player.  Roles will constantly be switched so as to create chaos.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
In random intervals players must chase after the other player.  With the constant change of who is chasing who with no consistency and the craziness of the stage, two players can enjoy the chaos with each other.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Color Tag is a simple multiplayer action game.  It is made primarily for more than one person to enjoy.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
In color tag two players will appear on different sides of the stage.  One will be a red character.  The other will be a cyan character.  Whichever player is the red character must chase after the cyan charcter, and touch them.  If they do they win the game! However there is two things that may impede the player.  For one the stage has several blocks, impeding players from moving straight around.  Second in a random interval of 8 to 13 seconds both players will swap colors.  When this happens the newly appointed red player now has a chance of tagging the other player and winning the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
The main goal of this prototype is to test an objects ability to move in four directions, and collide properly.  It is also testing the fun gameplay of a two player game.  Balance is a key mechanic to this game that must also be tested.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Many players enjoy playing games but in such a limited class sometimes, not everyone gets to play the games.  Sometimes players have to watch other players play the game.  Color tag is made to give players the excitment, and fun of chasing around your friends with the risk of them chasing you at any time.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
Color Tag takes place in a world of fire and ice.  On one side crystals exist while on the other lots of magma rocks occupy space.  These areas constantly tease each other, but tend to adapt to each others worlds, if they stay long enough.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
Here in the world of Firicia two clans exist; the clan of ice,and the clan of fire.  Both of prankster clans that enjoy teasing each other.  The fire clan often tries to come over and melt members of the ice clan.  The ice clan a group who enjoys playing around likes to run away.  Little did either clan know that by hanging with each other so much that they could become just like each other.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Color Tag targets any audience who enjoys a video game with a good rush too it.  Players should expect sudden turns of events for some fun stimulus.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Color Tag can take from up to 20 seconds to 2 minutes.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The best thing you can do is attempt to stay near the other player and chase them down.  However staying near them also puts you at risk of being touched when they change back.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Most images will be made in microsoft paint or photoshop.
</li>
